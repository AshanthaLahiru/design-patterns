# Observer Pattern

> Automatically notify objects of changes to the application state.

This pattern is commonly used in event-driven software to ensure that objects are aware of the application state. In this pattern, when the _subject_ class changes state, it automatically notifies all registered _observer_ classes of this change. This allows for the application to respond and be reconfigured based on state changes at runtime.
