# Null Object Pattern

> Reflect a do nothing relationship.

This pattern is commonly used to provide behavior in case data is not available. In most object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#, references may be null. These references need to be checked to ensure they are not null before invoking any methods, because methods typically cannot be invoked on null references.
