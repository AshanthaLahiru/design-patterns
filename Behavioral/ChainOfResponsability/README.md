# Chain of responsibility
Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.
The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any request messages from object to object until it reaches an object capable of handling the message. The number and type of handler objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically. The chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of handlers to be linked.

Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections. Instead of senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate successor in the chain.

Make sure there exists a "safety net" to "catch" any requests which go unhandled.

Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object should handle the request.
