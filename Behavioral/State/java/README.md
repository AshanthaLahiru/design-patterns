# State Pattern

> Automatically change behaviors depending on the internal states.

This pattern is commonly used in state machines to encapsulate various  behaviors based on its internal state. In this pattern, when the state changes, it automatically behaves depending on the state. This allows new states to be added independent from the existing state behaviors.
